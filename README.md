# Intelligent Vision System (All-in-One Computer Vision Toolkit)
A modular computer vision toolkit demonstrating the complete pipeline from image processing to depth estimation using Python and OpenCV.

## Overview
The Intelligent Vision System is a unified computer vision application designed to demonstrate the complete pipeline of vision-based processing. It integrates image processing, feature extraction, segmentation, object detection, classification, motion analysis, and depth estimation into a single modular system.

This project is designed to cover all major concepts of a Computer Vision syllabus while remaining simple, modular, and easy to implement.
